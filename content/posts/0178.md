# Hackers can now steal data from faraday cage air-gapped computers. 
https://thehackernews.com/2018/02/airgap-computer-hacking.html

- Techniques: Magneto and ODINI
- Malware generates a pattern of magnetic field frequencies by overloading the CPU with calculations that increase power consumption and generate a stronger magnetic field
- The malware leaves only a small footprint in the memory. 
- At the OS level the program requires no special privileges, works in user space (busy loops, mainly)
- MAGNETO is a short-distance attack, where an android app installed on the attacker’s smartphone can receive stolen data with the help of phone’s magnetometer (magnetic sensor)
- ODINI - slightly longer range using a dedicated magnetic sensor.

 Work               | Signal generation | Receiver          | Max bitrate   | Max distance
--------------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------|----------------
 ODINI              | CPU               | Magnetic sensor   | 40 bit/sec    | 100 to 150cm
 MAGNETO            | CPU               | Smartphone        | 5-0.2 bit/sec | 0 to 12cm
 Hard Disk Drive    | HDD               | Smartphone        | 2-0.06 bit/sec| 0 to 12cm


# Open Hardware Ecosystem with RISC-V
https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/riscv/

- RISC-V - free and open ISA standard
- ISA = Instruction Set Architecture
- RISC-V binutils, GCC, Linux and glib have been released by upstream as of Feb 1, 2018
- In 2010 - time to choose an ISA for next set of projects. Obvious choices: x86 and ARM
- X86 impossible - IP issues, too complex
- ARM mostly impossible - no 64-bit, IP issues, complex
- They started 3-month project, in summer 2010 to develop their own clean-slate ISA
- In 2014 they released the frozen base user spec (first release in may 2011)
- RISC-V is the smallest ISA for 32- and 64-bit addresses
- Current state:
    - User Mode ISA specification: 
        - ALU, branches, memory
        - M extension for multiplication
        - A extension for atomics
        - F and D extensions for single and double precision floating point
        - C extension for compressed instructions (16-bit)
    - Privileged Mode ISA specification:
        - Supervisor mode
        - Hypervisor mode
        - Machine mode
    - External Debug specification
        - Debug machine-mode software over JTAG
- Future of RISC-V
    - Debian, Fedore - bootstrap is in progress
    - V extension for vectors
    - J extension for JITs (primary target - is advanced JVMs)
- HiFive Unleashed: Multi-Core RISC-V Linux Development Board
    - 4+1 Multi-Core Coherent Configuration, up to 1.5GHz
    - 1x Gigabit Ethernet
    - 8GB 64-bit DDR4 with ECC
    - MicroSD card for removable storage
