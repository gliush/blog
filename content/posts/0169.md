# Paper "Shedding too much Light on a Microcontrollerâ€™s Firmware Protection"
 https://www.aisec.fraunhofer.de/content/dam/aisec/ResearchExcellence/woot17-paper-obermaier.pdf

- Every microcontroller has firmware readout protection
- Checked only STM32F0 family (entry-level microcontroller)
- Paper:
    - analysis of 3 security core components
    - detection of 3 weknesses + 3 ideas for their exploitation
        - Cold-Boot Stepping: enforcing single-stepping under limited debugging capabilities in Readout Protection (RDP) Level 1
        - Security Downgrade: Leveraging the lock-level design to downgrade the firmware protection setting
        - Debug Interface Exploit: Discovery of a race condition in the debug interface in RDP Level1
    - Proof of Concept for each weakness => vulnerabilities
    - discussion of impact
- STM32 Security Concept
