- Elixir History, versions
- 1.7 release: EEP (Elixir Enhancement Proposal) 48 (documentation standard)
- Community:
    - New podcasts
    - new ExDoc versions
    - Erlang/OTP 21 (compilation time is 20% faster)
    - Phoenix v1.3, Nerves v1.0
    - Nerves: ecosystem to build embedded systems with Elixir
        - https://nerves-project.org 
        - Platform (Linux starts  BEAM VM)
        - Framework: libraries
        - Tooling: to manage builds, update firmware, configure devices, etc
        - work via mix (mix firmware.burn -d /dev/rdisk3)
- Feedback from community
    - Difficult to contribute
    - now it’s transparent what team is doing
    - doubled the elixir team
- Criteria for new features
- Guidelines for new features
- on-going effort
    - code formatter
        - released in elixir-1.6
        - consistent style
        - focus you on what matters
        - guide for newcomers
        - unifies the community
    - property-based testing
        - useful to describe the invariants
        - (examples)
        - 2 lectures about property based language + book (The pragmatic programming)
        - StreamData will remain as a lib, outside of elixir-lang https://github.com/whatyouhide/stream_data
    - xhttp
        - HTTP client, architecture-agnostic
        - unifies the mechanisms to interact with HTTP1 and HTTP2
        - https://github.com/ericmj/xhttp
    - releases
        - will be part of core
        - will be smaller scope than in Distillery
        - https://dockyard.com/blog/2018/08/23/announcing-distillery-2-0
    - Type system
        - started and stopped working on the Type system
        - why? detect errors, documentation & tooling, performance
        - intersection types (converter: str->int, int->str) are very expensive -> impractical
    - the next 5 years
        - elixir v2.0 - not coming any soon
        - only 1 breaker change from 2014 - doc attribute
        - Elixir is extensible, plenty of “depraceted”  => 2.0 to remove deprecated
        - everything else - is in the hands of the community

# Remote Code Execution in Alpine Linux
https://justi.cz/security/2018/09/13/alpine-apk-rce.html

- .apk - is a gzipped tar files
- apk pull packages without TLS for default repos
- /etc/apk/commit_hooks.d/ folder with scripts to run when apk exists
- apk add works:
    - pull
    - extract into root (/)  (suffix with .apk-new)
        - extracted folder are not suffixed with .apk-new
    - checksumm
    - if incorrect remove all extracted files
- vulnerability. Create apk:
    - with “/etc/apk/commit_hooks.d/“ folder. Without “.apk-new” suffix
    - create symlink  /etc/apk/commit_hooks.d/x that points to “link” (-> link.apk-new)
    - create a regular file, named “link” (-> link.apk-new). This will write through the symlink and create a file at “/etc/apk/commit_hooks.d/x”
    - incorrect checksum -> remove everything:
        - unlink link.apk-new (the file /etc/apk/commit_hooks.d/x will persist)
        - unlink /etc/apk/commit_hooks.d -> ENONEMTPY error (contains our payload)
    - RESULT: apk commit-hook
- Step2. fix the exit code.
    - apk returns number of packages it failed to install (number%256 !!! )
    - write to the /proc/<pid>/mem for the apk process
- Conclusion: 100x of orgranizations might have problems in prod
- Fixed. Update your images.
