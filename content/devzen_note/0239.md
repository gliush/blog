# TektonCD: A Kubernetes-native pipeline resource
https://kurtmadel.com/posts/cicd-with-kubernetes/tekton-standardizing-native-kubernetes-cd/

- Part of CD foundation https://cd.foundation
- Golang
- Run on Kubernetes, k8s - first class citizen
- Apache-2.0 license
- Concepts:
  - Task - (k8s resource) work to be executed. Individually, or part of Pipeline
    - Runs as a Pod in k8s cluster
    - Each step in a separate container
  - TaskRun - (k8s resource) runs the Task
    - `kubectl get taskruns/mytask -o yaml` - to get results
  - PipelineResources - to define resources to be passed in/out of a task
    - types: git, image, cluster, storage
    - all the resources are used in tasks
  - Pipeline - list of tasks to execute in order
    - previous results could be used as input for the next task
  - PipelineRun - to execute a Pipeline
    - PipelineRun will create TaskRun for the each Tasks
- More features
  - Rich Auth capabilities
  - DAG (directed acyclic graph) of execution
- Roadmap
  - Notifications to Slack, email, Github PR, ...
  - Retries
  - Triggers
- IMHO
  - Good basement for a rich CD systems
  - Can't be used by itself
  - Jenkins X Pipelines uses Tekton
