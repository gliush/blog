# A million requests per second with Python
https://medium.freecodecamp.com/million-requests-per-second-with-python-95c137af319#.orernkeye

- Japronto
- c4.2xlarge with magnetic disks
- all contestants: single-worker process
- wrk 1 thread, 100 connections, 24 pipelined requests per connection
- if elb -> one connection, all requests in this connection
- Nagle algorithm -> many small requests in one TCP packet
- japronto glues response and write it back in one system call 
- Written in C. Parser, protocol, connection reaper, router, request and response objects - C Extensions
- elb support connection reuse http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/userguide/how-elastic-load-balancing-works.html
- pipelined is not supported for back-end connections: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/userguide/how-elastic-load-balancing-works.html

- Fencing off Go: Liveness and safety for channel-based programming https://blog.acolyer.org/2017/02/02/fencing-off-go-liveness-and-safety-for-channel-based-programming/ 
- Julien Lange https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~jlange/
- Static verification framework for liveness and safety in Go programs:
    - communication errors
    - partial deadlocks
    - (with dynamic channel creation, unbounded thread creation, recursion)
- tool chain is also available http://mrg.doc.ic.ac.uk/tools/gong/
- Go uses channels and goroutines for concurrency
- no callback-hell
- But: Communication mismatch and deadlocks
- Go runtime has a global deadlock detector (???)
- But no partial deadlock detectors
- GoInfer extracts concurrent behavioural types from a Go program
- Gong perform analysis on those types
- Static Single Assignment (SSA) package: IR -> system of type equations
- Language MiGo (mini-Go), which models the concurrency passing features of Go
- Given MiniGo, authors define an operational semantics and behavioural typing system for it (https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.1687: Behavioural Types for Actor Systems)
- type of channel carries type of objects it can send and receive
- Gong is written in Haskell!!!
- Gong check that all types are “fenced” (ограничены?), and if so - check all of them
- Fenced: we know that it will consist of a finite number of communication patterns (even infinite number of processes)
- Liveness is shown for 3 classes of programm
