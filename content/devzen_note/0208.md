# Introducing Thanos: Prometheus at scale
https://improbable.io/games/blog/thanos-prometheus-at-scale

- Prometheus: simple and reliable
- Problem: can’t scale: Petabytes of historic data,
- Default solution: [Hierarchical Federation](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/master/docs/federation.md#hierarchical-federation)
    {{< figure src="/images/0208_1.png" >}}
    - Leaf-prometheus servers, one meta-Prometheus server
    - Problems:
        - Configuration
        - Add  one more single point of failure
        - Complex rules to expose only certain data on the federated endpoint
        - Not all data is available from a single query API
- Another solution: HA pairs of Prometheus servers
    - independently collect data -> problem with deduplication
- Prometheus 2.0: total number of time series doesn’t impact server performance
- Downsampling: reduce sampling rate (to see the big picture)
- Thanos:

    - Prometheus Sidecar to store and query data
    - Querier: request data from all the sidecars, then run PromQL query agains the data (deduplication from HA pairs)
    - Object storage to store historic data in cloud storage. Align data (how?)
    - Immutable data: you can always write blocks to storage

    - Store component. Gossip -> are treated like Sidecar, used to cache and handle data in Storages
    {{< figure src="/images/0208_4.png" >}}
    - Files are large, slow to download => Store Gateway caches index parts of files, smart query planner => minimize requests to storage (get part of a file). 4-6 orders of magnitude faster than naive implementation.
    - => hard to distinguish object storage requests from local ssd requests
    - Compactor: apply Prometheus local compaction (downsampling) to the Object Storage.
    - Ruler: evaluates rules and alerts against Thanos Queriers. Then they are backed up to the Object Stores.
    - How to migrate from Prometheus (sequence of steps)
