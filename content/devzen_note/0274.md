https://www.cs.umd.edu/~basili/publications/proceedings/P125.pdf

- INTRODUCTION
- Software quality is obtain usually from:
  - code coverage
  - code churn
  - code complexity
  - code dependencies
- But not from "organizational structure" -> question they want to cover
- Conway's Law: "organizations that design systems are constrained 
    to produce systems which are copies of the communication structures 
    of these organizations
- Mythical Man Month: "the product quality is strongly affected by org structure" 
- RELATED WORK - great section about different papers about the topic
- ORGANIZATIONAL METRICS
  - Number of Engineers (NOE), who touched the binary and is still in the company
  - Number of Ex-Engineer (NOEE)
  - Edit Frequency (EF)
  - Depth of Master Ownership (DMO): level of the team who owns 75% of edits
  - Percentage of Org contributing to the development (PO)
  - Level of Organizational Code Ownership (OCO)
  - Overall Organization Ownership (OOW)
  - Organization Intersection Factor (OIF)
- CASE STUDY & RESULTS
  - Windows Vista bugs & code change information (from VCS)
