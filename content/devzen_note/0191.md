# The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Unexpected

- He is system architect, and always explain system design in OTP terms (even if he’s talking not about Erlang/Elixir)
- Where bugs come from: ￼from “unknown”: spectre/meltdown, thundering herd.

- Main target: move bugs from “unknown” to the “known” space. How?
    - Difficult: Increase knowledge of developers.
    - Simple: Hire more seniors (temptation: send seniors alone to the difficult parts. They’ll leave some day). Culture of teaching, mentorship, training, knowledge sharing.
    - Have more diverse team. The same background -> the same “known circle”. If you hire a team of people who love bitcoin -> they’ll come up with a solution that includes a blockchain, no matter what the problem was.
- Effective approach: exploratory testing. Pros: will discover plenty of bugs. Cons: difficult to find the tester
    - Fuzzing. AFL (American Fuzzy Lop), назван в честь кролика
    - In Erlang/Elixir world, Property based testing - is a must have. To find corner cases.
- When your team prove itself wrong - they hopefully reduce the gap between “you think you know” and “you know”
- Next general approach - do not go to the “unknown” area, put safeguards to prevent we do odd or unpredictable things:
    - write less code
    - formal methods (TLA+, exhaustive model checking, automated proof). Everything in your system is proven to work.
    - strict assertions, type signatures, type analysis
    - For erlang/elixir:
        - use dialyzer to prevent unexpected type errors and invalid states.
        - use code formatters
        - let it crash. do not try to massage unusable data into acceptable data.
    - If things go wrong, they won’t go wrong in the places you planned (no logging, few metrics -> 0 knowledge). So learn how to introspect the VM, how to use tracing, dig information (Erlang in Anger)
- Make “unknown” irrelevant: Group bugs and handle them the same way
    - Redundancy: one node breaks, send traffic to another nodes. No matter what the bug is -> overcome it.
    - Supervisors theory: types, how they start their children (depth-first)
    - how system works - is an easy stuff. how do you want the system to fail?
    - Supervisors theory: how to restart/fail
- Return error, let those, who has context, to decide.
- Drop messages, if you can’t handle them or use dead letter queue. (new message type, that is not handled yet, …)
- how can you know your supervision tree is right?
