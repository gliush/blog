https://helm.sh/blog/helm-3-released/
https://helm.sh/docs/faq/#changes-since-helm-2

- Removal of Tiller
  - RBAC by default in k8s-1.6 -> more difficult to manage tiller in prod
  - Permissive mode (simplicity) - is not good for prod
- 3-way merge patch
  - Helm 2 used two-way merge patch.
  - `kubectl edit` caused problems.
  - automatic manifest change caused problems (add sidecar)
  - now: old manifest, new manifest and the live state
- Release names are now scoped to Namespace
  - `helm list --namespace foo`
- Secrets as the default storage driver
- JSON schema -> chart values validation
- Consolidation of `requirements.yaml` into `Chart.yaml`
- Pushing Charts to OCI Registries (Docker Distribution)
- Application state:
  - Release Object - one per application. Metadata, link to a release version secrets
  - Release Version Secret - application desired state, for the current moment

# Language Bias in Accident Investigations
http://lup.lub.lu.se/luur/download?func=downloadFile&recordOId=2971193&fileOId=2971195

- The paper examined the language and content of the U.S. Forest Service's Serios Accident Investigation Guide (SAIG)
- Idea: check if it biased the accident analysis process (tl;dr - yes)
- The Influence of Philosophy on Accident Investigation
  - The influence is large.
  - Today's models are based on 'cause-end-effect' reasoning
  - They follow the need to create a logical pattern of 'facts' and 'conclusions'
  - Even when the existence of a pattern is questionable
- The evolution of Accident Models
  - Sequential accident model
    - WWI -> accidents in a munition factory. Some people are accident prone -> remove
    - 1931, Heinrich developed first sequential accident model 'Domino Theory'
    - => Humans were responsible for 80% of accidents, 20% were caused by unsafe conditions
    - It worked until the middle of 20 Century
    - Accident = uncontrolled energy release (physical impact)
  - Epidemiological Accident Model (Latent Failure Model)
    - 1978, Barry Turner developed 'Man-Made Disaster'.
    - Accident - organizational and sociological phenomena.
    - It is not the direct result of recent events or human acts, rather - result of long process
    - 1987 (after Chernobyl), James Reason - "Epidemiological Accident Model)
    - "All man-made systems have within them the seeds of their own destruction, like 'resident pathogen' in the human body"
    - No direct responsible person
  - Systemic Accident Model
    - Accident - is a normal part of a complex system. Inevitable part.
    - Accident - is not a result of sequence of causal events or failures.
- Language as Communication and Structure
  - Locke, Chomsky and Pinker: mental thought occurs prior to the formation of language
  - Whorf, Sapir, Wittgenstein: knowledge is created through language
  - People use "cognitive economy" - a less detailed method of language to communicate
  - => Shared experience is used -> problem if it is not shared
  - People desire simple explanation -> binary opposition.
  - => 'either-or' thinking can limit possibilities
  - The assignment of agency to an event is highly influenced by the language that is spoken
  -   i.e. English speakers - stronger tendency to assign agency to even unintentional events
  -   e.g. "active verb voice" -> more likely to blame someone
- Findings in the SAIG instructions ...
- My Summary
  - Active voice -> sense of control and causation that is lacking in the passive voice
  - Cognitive economy may fail to recognize more meanings in input data, especially if no shared background
  - No proper shared definition -> unintended conclusions
  - People by default uses Blame Culture
  - Sequential accident model is widely known, while others are not -> causality, human responsibility for everything
