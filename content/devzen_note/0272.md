# Release of Helm-3
https://helm.sh/blog/helm-3-released/
https://helm.sh/docs/faq/#changes-since-helm-2

- Removal of Tiller
  - RBAC by default in k8s-1.6 -> more difficult to manage tiller in prod
  - Permissive mode (simplicity) - is not good for prod
- 3-way merge patch
  - Helm 2 used two-way merge patch.
  - `kubectl edit` caused problems.
  - automatic manifest change caused problems (add sidecar)
  - now: old manifest, new manifest and the live state
- Release names are now scoped to Namespace
  - `helm list --namespace foo`
- Secrets as the default storage driver
- JSON schema -> chart values validation
- Consolidation of `requirements.yaml` into `Chart.yaml`
- Pushing Charts to OCI Registries (Docker Distribution)
- Application state:
  - Release Object - one per application. Metadata, link to a release version secrets
  - Release Version Secret - application desired state, for the current moment
