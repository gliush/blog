# Three States and a Plan: The A.I. of F.E.A.R.
http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~jorkin/gdc2006_orkin_jeff_fear.pdf

- Two state: Animate and Goto
- not FSM for satte
- FSM: how to behave in every situation. Procedural
- Planning system: set goals and actions and AI decide how to sequence actions to satisfy goals. Declarative
- STRIPS planning (STanford Research Institute Problem Solver). Actions: [preconditions] -> [effects]
- Goal: eliminate thread:
    - Fire gun? Load it first
    - Melee atack? Move close
- GameDesign: Edit scene: add goal for any scene
- Soldier, Assasin, Rat - the same goal, different ActionSets
- Benefit1: decoupling goals and actions
- Benefit2: Layering behaviours:
    - KillEnemy
    - Dodge goal
    - AtackMelee action
    - GoToNode (cover) -> then KillEnemy (no general plan, switch goals)
    - KillEnemyFromCover action
    - BlindFireFromCover action
    - Ambush goal (change position to a safer place)
- Benefit3: Dinamic Problem Solving
- Differences from STRIP:
    - 1. Cost per action. -> Graph of actions from current state to goal, A* to find optimal actions
