# XARs: An efficient system for self-contained executables
https://code.fb.com/data-infrastructure/xars-a-more-efficient-open-source-system-for-self-contained-executables/

- XAR: eXecutable ARchive to distribute software
- Alternative: PEX = self-contained Python virtual environments
- 1 file
- highly compressed
- all deps included
- can be run from anywhere in the system
- Python, Lua applications, Node.js applications, C++ exe and data files
- Initially: PAR (Python Archive), that decompress to tmp folder, run in folder
- Problems: decompressing each time, cleanup
- Alternative: PEX: decompress once, reuse it
- XAR uses squashfs files (mount before use, unmount after idle timeout)
- “nearly zero overhead” in prod
- Benchmark:
    {{< figure src="/images/0201_1.png" >}}
- XAR:
    - 4kb preamble = shebang pointing to a helper executable
    - helper tool xarexec_fuse that knows how to read optionally mount, and execute content
    - FUSE filesystem squashfs with zstd compression


# 11 Ways (Not) to Get Hacked in k8s
https://kubernetes.io/blog/2018/07/18/11-ways-not-to-get-hacked/

- CONTROL PLAN
    - 1. TLS Everywhere (between every component on the master, between Kubelet and API server)
    {{< figure src="/images/0201_2.png" >}}
    - Autoscaling: we should scale k8s instances, but shouldn’t include tls key into the image
    - Kubelet TLS bootstrapping documentation (didn’t read): add low-permissions keys to generate a proper key, auto-approve.
    {{< figure src="/images/0201_3.png" >}}
    - 2. Enable RBAC with least privilege, disable ABAC, monitor logs
    - 3. Use Third-party Auth for API Server: Google, Github, Dex (OpenID Connect Identity), … Single point to add/remove members, add/revoke permissions, 2FA, etc.
    - 4. Separate and Firewall your etcd Cluster Ability to write to etcd = have root on entire cluster. etcd should be on separate nodes, TLS certificates to work with it, firewall rules to allow access from API server only
    - 5. Rotate Encryption Keys. Some keys are rotated automatically (kubelet certs), but not all
- WORKLOADS
    - 6. Use Linux Security Features (SELinux, AppArmor, seccomp-bpf, …) and PodSecurityPolicies PodSecurityPolicy = cluster-level resource, that controls security aspects of pod spec.
    - 7. Statically Analyze YAML (kubesec https://kubesec.io), run unit tests for k8s configs (https://github.com/garethr/kubetest) Shift left testing concept https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift_left_testing
    - 8. Run containers as a Non-Root User.  Run as a Root in the container => you have root permissions on host. Container breakouts is needed, but risk is higher.
    - 9. Use Network Policies (restrict all pod-to-pod traffic)
    - 10. Scan Images and Run IDS (Intrusion Detection Systems). Admission controller gates - to check the Deployment/Pod/… Check content, mutate content. A lot of open-source scanners that prevent releasing containers with known vulnerabilities https://github.com/coreos/clair https://github.com/aquasecurity/microscanner Zero-day vulnerabilities - will alway exists, IDS should be added. Detects unusual behaviours in a container, pause or kills it: https://sysdig.com/product/secure/
- FUTURE
    - 11. Run a Service Mesh
