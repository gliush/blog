# Separation of compute and state in Google BigQuery and Cloud Dataflow (and why it matters)
https://cloud.google.com/blog/big-data/2017/10/separation-of-compute-and-state-in-google-bigquery-and-cloud-dataflow-and-why-it-matters

- separation = ability to maintain intermediate state between processing stages in a high performance component, separate from either the compute cluster or storage
- Benefits to separating compute from state:
    - Less state in compute -> it is more ephemeral and scalable. Easier to parallelize and easier to recover from a lost node
    - Processing stages donâ€™t conflict within the same compute node
    - Easier for the processing engine to re-partition the workload
    - Pipeline execution: stage N+1 before stage N is finished.
    - Resilience to node failures
    - Service can utilitize available resources more effeciently
