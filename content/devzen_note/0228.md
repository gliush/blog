# Hex package registry vulnerability
https://blog.voltone.net/post/22

- Fixed in rebar3-3.8.0 and Hex-0.19.0
- When you add a depp you should trust:
    - author of the code
    - the source code repo
    - package manager
    - package manager's hosting and CDN
    - package repository mirror
- We should also trust their ability to protect their systems from attackers!!
- The simplest protection: checksum and digital signature
- Hex Package Registry:
    - For each package Hex maintain a registry with list of all releases + properties
    - SHA256 - one of the properties
    - The registry is protected by a signature, generated with the Hex Server's private key
- Hex Client check registry signature, package SHA256 checksum
- Problem:
    - Hex server signed any package, and didn't include package name.
    - Send malicious package (that'll execulte bad code during `mix compile`)
    - Substitute the package on mirror
- Fix:
    - Include package name and organization name into the package on Hex server before singature
- IMHO:
    - Very difficult to foresee the problem
    - Do we have a 'all-purpose-security-check-list'?
    - Hackerone?
    - https://theupdateframework.github.io/ - is a solid approach
