# How Verizon and a BGP Optimizer Knocked Large Parts of the Internet Offline Today
https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-verizon-and-a-bgp-optimizer-knocked-large-parts-of-the-internet-offline-today/

- Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) - is a protocol to exchange routing tables
- BGP optimizer: splits up IP prefixes into smaller (more specific) parts
- Verison sent these rules into the internet
    {{< figure src="/images/0248_0.png" >}}
- 15% loss of global traffic 
- Verizon should have configured everything correctly long ago:
  - Configure hard limit prefixes to be received
  - IRR-based filtering
  - RPKI framework with BGP Origin Validation (AT&T have enabld it)
  - All these ideas are defined in the MANRS ([Mutually Agreed Norms for Routing Security](https://www.manrs.org/))
- "**And there's no good reason, other than sloppiness or laziness**" (about Verizon)
- They fixed it by phone: calling the DQE to stop advertizing the incorrect BGP routes (screensot of phone calls is attached)
