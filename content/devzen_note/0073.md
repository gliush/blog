# Fuck the Cloud

(comments are on https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10771539)

- Manifesto about the position
- Cloud is a vital part that you don’t own or control
- “Cloud” was used to represent outside network since 1980s
- If you fail - who blame you? It’s a cloud. Soft, huggable cloud.
- if you lose your shit, the technologies will not help you. They will giggle at you and make fun of your not understanding the fundamental principles and engineering of client-server models
- The question is about value
- Porn, music, films - you can redownload
- The thing you make: writing, linking of friends, … -  everything is gone when you’re died
- If you’re not asking what stuff means anything to you - you are a sucker, ready to throw your stuff down.
- But some people are dumping hundreds of hours a year into the cloud (photos, opinions, relations, …)
- Internet - is a big copy machine
- Blows copies into the cloud, but please:
    - don’t blow anything that you don’t have a personal copy of
    - insult, berate any company that offers you something, that you can’t make copies out of
    - Recognise a Cloud when you see it. Pay to become a customer.
    - If you want to take advantage of the froth - do so, but these are parties, and not home.
