# Local-first software. You own your data, in spite of the cloud
https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first.html

- Cloud is convenient, but you don't have your data. Services dies - you loose your data
- They suggest a set of principles of "Local-first software":
  - work offline
  - work collaborative (gdoc, trello, etc)
  - across multiple devices
  - improve security, privacy
  - user controls the data
- PRINCIPLES
  - No spinners: your work at your fingertips. Should not require roundtrip to server
  {{< figure src="/images/0241_0.png" >}}
  - You work is not trapped to one device (sync to servers in background)
  - The network is optional
  - Seamless collaboration with your colleagues. Biggest challenge
  - The Long Now. Your work should be accessible indefinitely, even after the company that produced the software is gone. No more "we close the product" for SaaS.
  - Security and Privacy by default. End-to-end encryption.
  - You retain the ultimate control. No problem on service side will stop your access.
- Several examples: email, gdoc, trello, dropbox, git 
- CRDT is a foundation technology. Link to a lot of CRDT papers.
- Automerge https://github.com/automerge/automerge examples (video + exampl app)
  - Trellis (Trello analogue)
  - PixelPusher (collaborative drawer)
  - PushPin (Media canvas)
- Findings:
  - CRDT works
  - Conflicts are not as significant a problem as we feared.
  - Visualizing document history is important
- IMHO:
  - The idea gets the best from Local Apps and SaaS.
