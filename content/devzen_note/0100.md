# etcd3
https://coreos.com/blog/etcd3-a-new-etcd.html

- already integrated into Kubernetes 
- a lot of features: distributed locks, elections, STM
- originally - for CoreOS updates. Now - for different purposes, not always good
- gprc for efficiency (protobuf). JSON is through a gRPC gateway. HTTP2 to multiplex streams over single TCP.
- key TTL (request + connection to refresh each key + consensus proposal to update the key)> lightweight streaming lease keepalive model (lease per several keys)
- watchers -> multiplexer watches on a single connection (several keys)
- data model with reliable events. etcd2: older version of values are discarded (no way to reconstruct prev state). etcd3: mvcc (discard old values on a timer)
- key hierarchies  -> flat binary key space with search queries  (by prefixes)
- single conditional mini-transaction (sevaral checks + list of operations to apply)

# Kubernetes 1.3
http://blog.kubernetes.io/2016/07/kubernetes-1.3-bridging-cloud-native-and-enterprise-workloads.html

- increased scale. 2x max number of hosts in cluster
- Simplified autoscale (custom metrics: queries per sec)
- Cross-cluster federated services (AWS/GCE  DNS) = Ubernetes-lite???
- Stateful apps:
    - PetSet (alpha): permanent hostnames, automatically provisioned persistent disk, unique identities in a group (for clustering and leader election), 
    - one-time init setup for stateful containers (alpha)
- Minikube - Ease of use for local development
- Support for rkt and conatiner standards OCI (open container initiative) & CNI (container network interface)
- updated dashboard UI
- Authorization
    - RBAC  authorization API group (alpha)
    - Webhook Token Authenticator
