# Introducing ebpf_exporter
https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-ebpf_exporter/

- Two main options to collect system metrics
    - node_exporter: gauges and counters with lots of plugins
    - cAdvisor: gauges and counters for container level metrics
- Counters are great, but they lack details about individual events
- rate() - is 1 sec change, so > 1sec is impossible to get
- Histograms - better, but node_exporter - only counters
- Datazaurus picture => any plot to preserve the same mean + standard deviation values
- Histogram - shows the truth
- io + linux kernel => ?
    - should have low overhead
    - universal
    - should be supported out of the box
    - safe
- => eBPF = sandboxed, low overhead, user-defined bytecode in kernel
    - can never crash
    - can’t interfere with kernel negatively
    - c -> bcc (llvm based) -> kernel bytecode
- examples:
    - directory cache lookups times
    - slow ext4 operations
    - L3 CPU cache hit
    - etc
- map keys to labels (disk names, function names, cpu number)
- ebpf_exporter repo with examples
- complex example
    - tracepoint fires -> increment counter for function address)
    - function address -> hash -> `ksym` decoder (/proc/kallsyms)
    - => graph of counters “what function the kernel is in”
