# RAMBleed
- Better read the paper, it's not that difficult
- Idea1: All the memory cells during reads could influence cells in the same column on the nearest row
- Idea2: Put your memory between rows with a secret (how to do that explained below):
{{< figure src="/images/0247_0.png" >}}
- As you have EQUAL cells containing secret above and below your cell, they will influence the same way.
- Perform many reads in (A0) cells, that will the cells with secrets activate cells in your memory
- If you had `0` in your cell and after the experiment, it didn't change -> secret has `0` in the corresponding cell
- If you had `0` in your cell and after the experiment, it switched to `1` -> secret has `1` in the corresponding cell
- PROFIT!
- All other 17 pages of the paper they explain how to put a secret in the needed places and how DRAM works
