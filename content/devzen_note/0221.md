# New Logger in Erlang
https://ferd.ca/erlang-otp-21-s-new-logger.html

- OTP-21 -> new logging library in Erlang - `logger`
- an alternative and “result” of `lager` library
- STRUCTURE
    - you should not know the structure of `logger` to use it. But to extend - you should
    - `logger` exposes 3 types of components with well-defined interfaces
        - Log Filters
        - Log Handlers
        - Log Formatters
    - These elements are in config database (ETS -> cheap)
    - You want to log asap (move everything to another process).
    - For Erlang (preemptive concurrency) logger might be a bottleneck:
       {{< figure src="/images/0221_1.png" >}}
    - => we want to distribute this work as much as possible at the call-site
    - quick -> will not be noticeable
       {{< figure src="/images/0221_2.png" >}}
    - as logger-configuration is ready for concurrent reading -> easy to implement
- DATA FLOW
    - check level, get logger config
    - apply general filters, apply handlers (+filters +formatters)
    - skip logging on any level
    - disk logging - one process that handle a file descriptor
- GOOD LOGGING
    - log what you know/observe, not your deductions (ssl problems -> “your system is hacked”)
    - single way to produce logs -> auto dispatch to different storage based on content
    - structured logs (maps of maps -> handler to flatten or json them)
- MORE
    - distributed tracing work nicely with the logger
    - metrics from log - too
    - which fields logs should contain (table)
