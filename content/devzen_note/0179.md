# Paper "Partisan: Enabling Cloud-Scale Erlang Applications"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.02652

- Models:
    - Full mesh model
    - client-server model
    - peer-to-peer model
    - publish-subscribe model
- Usually, the runtime support for distributed applications is not needed. But several counter-examples: Akka cluster, Microsoft Orleans, Distributed Erlang
- single topology is insufficient
- Partisan: distributed programming model + distributed layer = alternative to Distributed Erlang.
- 2 important improvements over Distributed Erlang:
    - addition of multiple runtime-selectable cluster topologies
    - ability to gain additional parallelism by distributing messages over multiple communication channels
- Default topology: full mesh
- But can distribute traffic over multiple connections to avoid congestion problem observed in Distributed Erlang
- Consider 2 application scenarios:
    - distributed database with large objects on smaller clusters (10s of nodes)
    - lightweight replicated k-v store (100-1000s of nodes)
- communication channels -> 30x improvements on point-to-point massaging, 13.5x on distributed database application.
- specify topology at runtime -> 256 nodes in cluster -> 1024 nodes
- Contribution of this paper:
    - design of the Partisan programming model, that supports the runtime specification of multiple cluster topologies
    - design of the channel-based full mesh backend
    - open source implementation of Partisan
    - detailed evaluation of Partisan
- 3.1 Partisan Programming Model:
    - 2 sets of operations: membership operations (join + remove Erlang nodes from the cluster) messaging operations (async deliver messages between nodes)
    - topology-agnostic and async
    - Messaging is async and best-effort: in full mesh - directly to the node, in peer-to-peer mode a message may have  to be forwarded through several nodes.
- 3.2 API
    - Join: join a node to the cluster
    - Self Leave / Leave
    - Members
    - Forward Message
    - Cast Message
- 3.3 Topologies:
    - Static: explicit configuration at the deployment time
    - Full Mesh: single TCP connection for Erlang nodes + Channels
    - Client-Server
    - Peer-to-Peer: all clients connect to one other client in the system
    - Publish-subscribe: Partisan will connect to preconfigured AMQP message broker for node-to-node messaging and dissemination of cluster membership information.

- 4. Evaluation
- 6 Conclusion:
    - 13.5x-30x performance improvement for real Erlang applications
    - Performance gains for Riak Core -> for all similar apps.
