# Itâ€™s Time to Move on from Two Phase Commit
http://dbmsmusings.blogspot.com/2019/01/its-time-to-move-on-from-two-phase.html

- 2PC is used in industry > 30yrs
- Briefly, what is 2PC
- 2PC problems:
    - Blocking problem: coordinator fails before final decision. Wait until coordinator recovers. Work arounds reduce performance
    - Cloggage problem: until the end of second phase workers have to stop other conflicting transactions, and their conflicting transactions, etc
- To sum up 2PC problems: latency, throughput, scalability, availability
- Conceptually, main 2PC problem: worker can abort after the work is done (1st phase).
- We need to change how distributed systems are architected
    - A transaction may abort at any time for any reason
    - System shouldn't have freedom to abort transaction. Only logic within the transaction could abort
- Example:
    - Shard1: X = 42   Shard2: Y -= 1; if (Y &lt; 0) ABORT; Z = Y
    - Simplified to:
    - Shard1: if(remote_read(Y) &gt; 0) X = 42;    Shard2: if (Y &gt; 0) {Y -= 1; Z = Y}
- All conditions are known before -> no need to abort -> no need for transaction protocol
    - IMHO: Whaaat?? how to coordinate reading from remote hosts?? What if 2 concurrent transaction does Y-=1??
- 2 types of abort:
    - Caused by the state of the data (solved above)
    - Caused by the system itself (solved below)
- IMHO:
    - I don't understand, how concurrent transaction is handled ( Y-=1, the question above)
    - We need some additional "solver" that'll change all the workers logic on the fly?
    - What if remote worker is not available or high latency? (We'll solve it later? eventual consistency?)
    - O(n^2), that author suggests solving by broadcasting all the values to all the workers -> incoming queue -> GC -> HELL
