# Lessons from 6 software rewrite stories
https://medium.com/@herbcaudill/lessons-from-6-software-rewrite-stories-635e4c8f7c22

- Joel Spolsky's essay that you shouldn't rewrite your service [Things You Should Never Do](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/)
- But "It depends". Several examples + some lessons
- Netscape -> Mozilla -> Firefox
  - Netscape valued ~$10B, and dicided to rewrite its browser v4.0 -> v5.0 (OpenSourced)
  - v6.0 from scratch as previous version didn't work
  - Firefox in 2002 (trully open sourced by Mozilla)
  - **Lessons**: IE6 era caused by it; Company lost its value; Bad decision
- Basecamp -> Basecamp2 -> Basecamp3
  - In several years after Basecamp - large tech debt, slow evolving, need to do smth
  - Decided to start a new Basecamp2, while supporting (forever!) previous version
  - Later - Basecamp3, while supporting (forever!) previous version
  - They encourage users to switch, but don't close the previous versions
  - **Lessons**: Huge win, though they need to support previous versions
- Visual Studio -> VSCode
  - Microsoft had internal IDE, that didn't work outside.
  - Decided to suggest something new for everybody (open source + "new era of Microsoft")
  - Greatly pluggable -> tens of thousands of external plugins
  - **Lessons**: Succeeded in building an active open source community; very popular product
- Gmail + Inbox
  - Inbox - is another UI for the same backend. Experiment
  - A lot of features were ported from Inbox to Gmail
  - **Lessons**: experiments with features without disrupting workflows; a lot of criticism for closing Inbox; should have copied all features to improve happiness
- FogBugz & Trello
  - FogBugz was huge in 10 years.  Jira was more successfull.
  - Decided to copy all Jira features so that "users didn't have any reason to choose Jira over Trello"
  - Wanted to add "joy and interest to developers" -> started Trello
  - Created another project for collaborative programming env -> created Glitch
  - **Lessons**: happy developers -> great product; StackOverflow, Trello, Glitch as side projects of FogBugz; FogBugz is dead (sad)
- FreshBooks & BillSpring
  - FreshBooks were created not by developers -> huge tech debt
  - Decided to secretly create a new product (competitor on the market)
  - When it got some success -> announced that it is a new version.
  - **Lessons**: build something next to your current product (that works) is a good idea
