Testing in Production, the safe way

- It is not easy, it is not risk-free.
- Often "staging" = "miniature replica of production"
- Need to keep stage "in-sync" with production, which is almost impossible:
  - Impossible to copy production data (GDPR, etc)
  - The size of staging cluster
  - Different configuration of LB, DB, Queues, etc (# of connections opened, # of replicas live, # of Kafka partitions, etc)
  - Different monitoring configuration (because traffic is not similar to production)
- Some testing better to perform on prod (long-living tests, memory leaks, unusual CPU usage patterns)
- Testing in prod requires:
  - Huge automation
  - Understanding of best practices
  - Prepared design of the system
- Best effort simulation of the production is - production

- Production consists of 3 phases:
- Phase 1 - Deploy
  - Process of installing new version to production servers
  - Deploy does not expose users to the new version
- Phase 2 - Release
  - Process of moving production traffic to the new version
  - Up to several days
  - In case of any problem - rollback to the previous version
  - Best, when automated
- Phase 3 - Post-Release
  - Some degree of degradation all the time (something is broken)

- Testing in Production in the Deploy Phase.
  - Integration testing: just use prod env, do not try to copy it
    - Deploy services (without releasing, e.g., with new labels), but use in Testing
    - Service Mesh helps
    - New DB row for testing, do not touch production data
  - Shadowing (= Dark Traffic Testing = Mirroring)
    - Production traffic is captured and replayed against newly deployed version
  - Tap Compare
    - Send traffic to the new version and to previous version => And compare the results
  - Load Testing
  - Config Tests
    - Canary release to test configuration.
    - No other test could find problems
- Testing in Production in the Release Phase.
  - Canarying
  - Monitoring
  - Exception Tracking
  - Traffic Shaping (0% -> 100% and back in case of problem)
- Testing in Production in the Post-Release Phase.
  - Feature Flagging or Dark Launch
  - A/B Testing
  - Logs/Events, Metrics and Tracing
  - Profiling
  - Teeing
