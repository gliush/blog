# Docker-1.12 
https://blog.docker.com/2016/06/docker-1-12-built-in-orchestration/

- built-in orchestration. One binary (git style?)
- docker swarm init - creates a Raft with one node. Adding nodes either worker (default) or managers
- PR: docker design is based on 4 principles 
- resilience: restart container on another node if a node fails
- Security: TLS, certificate rotation 30min, 
- Bundles: image + network + network of containers interaction
- gRPC for inter-node communication (HTTP/2 multiplexing and header compression)
- protobufs

# Erlang-19.0
http://erlang.org/download/otp_src_19.0.readme

- erts: trace improved, microstate accounting
- compiler: ?FUNCTION_NAME, ?FUNCTION_ARITY
- stdlib: gen_fsm -> gen_statem (“not quite experimental”)
- process_info(message_queue_data)
- Unix Domain Sockets (read code, no docs)
- parser doesn’t insert “undefined” value to records
- TADAM: compiler no long put compilation date into BEAM!!! (md5 - comparison if beam is the same as in memory)
